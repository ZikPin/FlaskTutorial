# FlaskTutorial
A tutorial web-page from the flask documentation page: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/tutorial/

The application uses factory to create the app and contains two blueprints:
1. For authentication
2. For blogposts

## Chapters finished in the tutorial are:
- Project Layout
- Application Setup
- Define and Access the Database
- Blueprints and Views
- Templates
- Static files
- Blog Blueprint
- Make the Project Installable
- Test Coverage

## Would be interesting to implement
- A detail view to show a single post. Click a post’s title to go to its page.
- Like / unlike a post.
- Comments.
- Tags. Clicking a tag shows all the posts with that tag.
- A search box that filters the index page by name.
- Paged display. Only show 5 posts per page.
- Upload an image to go along with a post.
- Format posts using Markdown.
- An RSS feed of new posts.
